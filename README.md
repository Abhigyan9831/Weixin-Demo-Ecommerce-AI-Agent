# Weixin-Demo-Ecommerce-AI-Agent

## Introduction

A Multilingual E-commerce AI Assistant with Sentiment Analysis, Product Search, Offer Engine & Customer Memory-- This project is a prototype of an AI-powered customer service agent designed for WeChat, Weixin, for e-commerce platforms. It has custom inbuilt tools handles customer reviews, provides personalized offers, fetches product details, and maintains long-term customer interaction history. It is a demo built with LangChain, Ollama, Python, TextBlob, and SQLite, it mimics the behavior of a real customer support representative. UI is created using streamlit for faster inference. At first I used (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free model) from [Openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/), but later I shifted to Local LLM which are more powerful and faster inference latency from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). This completely optional.
